      <p3>This is my game called make your own Acai Bowl. In this game you will be able to 
      make your own acai bowl with our customization options. These options include a wide
	variety of fruits, protein options and at the end topping to top it off. The turtle
      takes in your input and asks you the quantity and then proceeds to draw the required 
      ingredients.</p3>
