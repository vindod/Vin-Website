      <p3>This is my game called make your own Acai Bowl. In this game you will be able to 
      make your own acai bowl with our customization options. These options include a wide
	variety of fruits, protein options and at the end topping to top it off. The turtle
      takes in your input and asks you the quantity and then proceeds to draw the required 
      ingredients.</p3>

	trying to escape the galaxy you were put into but you will be teleported in 30 seconds.

	    <p3> This is our spiderman postcard where you defeat spiderman villains, once you defeat them, spiderman 
	    comes down crawling from a victory screen and drops an inspirational quote, while there is spiderman music. </p3>

	    <p3>This is our scratch project where we built it so that there is a ninja that is trying to avoid and defeat the enemies which are slimes
		    with his swords that he uses. This code was easier to construct than python because we could physically see what each codes function was
		    rather than us figuring out which code is right to put in there.</p3>

	    <p3>Based on our analysis, we believe the rover collected data from the Rocky Mountain region, as high noise levels
	    and interrupted light reflections caused by cloud cover aligned with patters we observed in comparison graphs, with light
	    data ultimately distinguishing it from the desert plains.</p3>
